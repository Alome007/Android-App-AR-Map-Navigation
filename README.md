# Android-App-AR-Map-Navigation

This is a proof of concept app that uses AR to guide users in an indoor environment. It was built over the course of two months for NUS Orbital 2018. 
The app uses WIFI fingerprinting to perform indoor location. It can be used within NUS COM 1 (I believe the server is still running). The app consists of two parts
a part which contains the routing and UI logic, and another which contains the AR overlay. The map itself is rendered using mapbox.
